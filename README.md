# Spotify Clone - HTML & CSS

This project is a static, responsive Spotify clone created using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to replicate the core visual design and layout of Spotify's web interface, focusing on the navigation, music player controls, and song display sections. 

Though it does not have interactive functionality (like a working music player), it mimics the structure and style of Spotify's user interface, offering a visually appealing layout with modern design principles.

## Features:
- Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout adjusts to various screen sizes using media queries.
- Navigation Bar: A simple, clean navigation bar that mimics the look of Spotify's main navigation menu.
- Custom Music Player Layout: Designed to look like a functional music player with buttons for play, pause, forward, backward, and volume control. The buttons are styled to resemble Spotify's UI.
- Dynamic Song Display: A grid layout showcasing album artwork, song titles, and other elements commonly seen in Spotify's song list.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML: The structure and markup of the page, including the navigation bar, music player, and song display.
- CSS: Styling the page with a focus on responsive design and layout. Used to create the layout, colors, fonts, and button styles to resemble the Spotify interface.
